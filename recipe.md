## recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 
2. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.
3. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined.
4.  Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed.
5.  Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.)
6.  Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.
7. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. 
8. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. 
9. Remove the parchment. 
10. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.
